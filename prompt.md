Excellent — you’re asking for a **context capsule**: a self-contained summary you can paste into a new chat to rehydrate all the project context so you can continue coding without losing fidelity.

Here’s that exact text — concise enough to fit in a new prompt, but detailed enough for me (or any model) to instantly understand what you’re doing and how far you’ve gotten.

### 🧠 **ECAC Prototype Context Capsule**

I’m building a **research prototype** implementing the *Eventually Consistent Access Control (ECAC)* model described in my paper — it’s a local-first, CRDT-based access-control framework for multi-stakeholder collaboration (ReMaNet/Industry 4.0 context).
The prototype’s design and development plan was broken into **12 milestones (M1–M12)**. All 12 are complete in specification; now I need to code, test, and refine modules step by step.
Here’s what the project is and what exists conceptually so far:

#### 🎯 **Core Idea**

A distributed system where:

* All actions (data edits + policy changes) are **signed, hash-linked events** in a causal DAG (CRDT core).
* Nodes can **work offline** using “best knowledge,” then **sync later** via gossip.
* On sync, a deterministic **replay** with a **deny-wins rule** removes or rolls back operations that became unauthorized due to revocations.
* Every replica converges to the same **policy-correct final state**.

| **M10** | In-band issuer keys and status lists (TrustView) → self-contained verification.       |

| **M12** | Paper documentation, evaluation summary, reproducibility manifest, final release tag. |

#### 🔐 **Security & Correctness Guarantees**

* **Integrity:** All ops and audit entries are signed and hash-linked.
* **Convergence:** Topological replay (causal + tie-break) yields same state on all replicas.
* **Policy Safety:** Unauthorized ops are removed by deny-wins reconciliation.
* **Confidentiality:** Tag-scoped encryption with key rotation; no plaintext for unauthorized users.
* **Accountability:** Audit log cross-verifies Applied/Skipped ops; tamper-evident.
* **Trust autonomy:** All verification artifacts (issuer keys, revocation lists) live inside the same log.

---

#### 🧪 **Evaluation Setup**

* Benchmarks (M7): measure convergence latency, rollback count, replay time.
* Scenarios:

  * **HB-chain** (baseline),
  * **Concurrent writers** (CRDT stress),
  * **Offline edit + revoke** (deny-wins),
  * **Partitioned gossip sync** (M6 test).
* Metrics exported as CSV + JSONL; reproducible via `scripts/reproduce.sh`.

#### 🧾 **Current State**

All architectural milestones are specified.
Next steps are **coding the crates** and iterating feature-by-feature (starting from `core/` → `policy/` → `store/` → `net/`).
All CRDT, replay, and deny-wins semantics are fully defined; the focus now is correct implementation and test harness setup.

---

#### 🧩 **Key invariants**

1. **Convergence:** For any two replicas that see the same set of ops, their materialized state is identical.
2. **Policy Safety:** Final state contains no effects of operations that violate current policy.
3. **Audit Integrity:** Audit chain hash-link and signatures verify.
4. **Deterministic Replay:** Given same events, total order and resulting state are identical across runs.

---

#### ✅ **Definition of Done**

A tagged release `v1.0-paper` that:

* passes all tests (unit, property, integration),
* passes `audit-verify` and `trust-dump`,
* reproduces golden CSV/JSON metrics exactly,
* builds via pinned Docker/Nix image,
* produces SBOM + signed artifacts,
* contains all docs in `/docs/paper/`.

---

You can assume all the above as context and start coding, testing, or generating code for any specific module or feature.
When I say something like “let’s implement the DAG store,” or “write the deny-wins replay loop,” treat all this as background context and proceed accordingly.
