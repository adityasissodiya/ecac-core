Perfect — let’s close the loop.

# M12 — Paper Artifacts, Documentation & Recap

This milestone doesn’t add features. It freezes the repo, packages the paper-facing artifacts, and documents **everything we built**.
The deliverable is the **final paper bundle**: model, proofs, metrics, trust view, and reproducibility data.

---

## Goal

Create a **complete, self-explanatory artifact package** that mirrors what the paper describes:

* all code and schema definitions frozen,
* a single `docs/paper/` directory containing:

  * the short “model” write-up,
  * proof sketches and invariants,
  * the evaluation summary tables,
  * the induction-motor case walkthrough,
  * the threat model,
  * and the reproducibility manifest (from M11).

The repo at the tagged commit must be *runnable, verifiable, and citable.*

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Paper-ready documentation tree

```
docs/
 ├── paper/
 │    ├── model.md
 │    ├── invariants.md
 │    ├── usecase_induction_motor.md
 │    ├── evaluation_summary.md
 │    ├── threat_model.md
 │    ├── reproducibility_manifest.md
 │    ├── architecture_diagram.svg

 ├── eval/out/                # From M7–M11
 └── eval/golden/
```

#### `model.md`

* Precise definition of event format (Ops, Policy, Trust, Key, Audit).
* Merge rule formula:

  > state = apply(sorted(events) \ unauthorized(events))
* Deny-wins semantics and causal DAG description.

#### `invariants.md`

* Two invariants, both restated formally:

  * **Convergence:** all replicas that have seen the same event set end with identical state.
  * **Policy Safety:** no unauthorized operation influences final state.
* Short proof sketches linking to M9 audit cross-checks and property tests.

#### `usecase_induction_motor.md`

* Step-by-step log of the motor refurbish/upgrade case:

  * actors, tags, and credentials,
  * one offline edit + concurrent revocation,
  * replay transcript showing rollback.
* Terminal output excerpts from the CLI scenario.

#### `evaluation_summary.md`

* Tables from M7 CSVs:

  | Scenario       | Ops | Revokes | Skipped | Replay ms | Convergence ms |
  | -------------- | --- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------------- |
  | hb-chain       | 200 | 0       | 0       | 12        | 0              |
  | concurrent     | 200 | 0       | 0       | 14        | 0              |
  | offline-revoke | 200 | 3       | 6       | 15        | 32             |
* Include 2-3 figures generated by `plot.py`.

#### `threat_model.md`

* Enumerate what is **guaranteed** (integrity, authN, auditability, eventual policy correctness)
  and what is **not** (temporary disclosure offline, endpoint compromise).
* Cite the cryptographic basis (Ed25519, XChaCha20, BLAKE3) and assumptions (honest-but-curious peers, eventual delivery).

#### `reproducibility_manifest.md`

* Reference commit hash, Rust toolchain version, container hash, and SHA256SUM of `ecac-artifacts-<gitsha>.tar.gz`.
* Pointer to golden artifacts, SBOM, and CI badge.

---

### 2. Tag and version freeze

* Tag repository as `v1.0-paper`.
* Create a **GitHub release** attaching:

  * `ecac-artifacts-<gitsha>.tar.gz`
  * `sbom.json`
  * `SHA256SUMS`
  * `cosign.sig`
  * `docs/paper/*`

---

### 3. Paper cross-references

In your LaTeX or IEEE Access source, reference:

```latex
\footnote{Artifact DOI: https://github.com/<you>/ecac-core/releases/tag/v1.0-paper}
```

and include:

* Figure: “Deny-Wins Replay Timeline” (from `docs/paper/deny_wins_timeline.png`)
* Table: “Evaluation Summary” (from `evaluation_summary.md`)
* Listing: snippet of the audit verification output showing skip reasoning.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (binary)

1. `make repro` completes and reproduces **identical artifacts** on CI and local.
2. Every doc in `docs/paper/` builds without external dependencies.
3. All claims in the paper are backed by reproducible evidence in `/docs/eval/out/`.
4. README lists:

   * one-line install/run,
   * artifact DOI,
   * supported OS,
   * citation line.
5. CI `repro.yml` + `audit-verify` both green on tag.
6. Tarball + SBOM verified (`cosign verify-blob` passes).

## Recap — What We Achieved Across M1–M12

| Milestone | Core Outcome                                                                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M1**    | Defined and implemented signed, hash-linked ops and causal DAG (foundation for determinism). |
| **M2**    | Added deterministic replay + MVReg/OR-Set CRDTs ensuring eventual consistency.               |
| **M3**    | Integrated authorization epochs + deny-wins replay (retroactive rollback).                   |
| **M4**    | Verified-credential backed grants with issuer trust and status checks.                       |
| **M5**    | Durable RocksDB log, checkpoints, crash recovery, bit-for-bit determinism.                   |
| **M6**    | libp2p gossip sync → convergence across peers under partitions.                              |
| **M7**    | Metrics + bench harness → quantified convergence latency, rollback, replay cost.             |
| **M8**    | Tamper-evident audit trail; offline verifiable Applied/Skipped reasoning.                    |
| **M9**    | Confidential read-control via per-tag encryption + key rotation (forward secrecy).           |
| **M10**   | In-band issuer keys & revocation (TrustView) → fully self-contained trust.                   |
| **M11**   | Reproducible build pipeline, golden artifacts, CI verification, SBOM.                        |
| **M12**   | Paper-ready docs, evaluation summaries, release tagging, DOI linking.                        |

### End State

You now have a **verifiable, offline-capable, eventually consistent access-control system**:

* **Core correctness:** proved convergence and policy-safety through deterministic replay.
* **Security:** per-op signatures, tamper-evident logs, VC-backed authorization, and forward-secret encryption.
* **Robustness:** durable store + gossip sync → consistent recovery after partitions.
* **Accountability:** full audit chain and reproducible artifacts.
* **Relevance:** demonstrates ReMaNet-style multi-stakeholder remanufacturing with DPP-aligned access semantics.

### What’s left (if you ever extend it)

* Historical re-encryption for backward secrecy.
* Byzantine resilience / threshold signatures.
* Policy language expansion (temporal ABAC).
* UI polish (local-first viewer).

---

With M12, you’re done.
Your prototype, documentation, and artifacts now satisfy **every deliverable** promised in the paper: model, proof, use case, metrics, threat assumptions, and a reproducible build.
